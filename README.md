The best way to build animation compositions for React. Design and compose a
component to start with, a component to end with, and Flight will take it from
there.

Flight tries to be for React what [Principle](http://principleformac.com/) is
for Sketch compositions - the fastest, most friction free way to compose and an
effortless way to animate an idea, an interaction, or a short movie-like
composition in a self-contained widget (a React component after all).

React Flight in Three Minutes
</a>

## Quick Start (From Scratch)

Just clone and use the example, built around `create-react-app`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jondot/react-flight
$ cd react-flight/examples/compos
$ yarn && yarn start
```


## Quick Start (Existing Project)

With yarn (or npm):

```
$ yarn add react-flight
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jondot/react-flight/master/examples/compos/src/index.js -o src/anim.js
```

And now you can frame your compositions in `anim.js`, require and place it in
any other React component.

Next:

1. Add jQuery (or Zepto, or any jQuery drop-in) if you don't have it already in the project.
2. Or if you use `create-react-app` you can add it to your `public/index.html`, [like here](examples/compos/public/index.html),
or eject and [configure webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/library-and-externals.html) for jQuery.

_NOTE_: jQuery is currently a requirement of one of `react-flight`'s dependencies.
We plan to rebuild that dependency any way, obsoleting this requirement in the
process (also: PRs accepted!).

## Workflow

When you're designing compositions, focus on designing frames. The
first frame is marked `source` because that's the starting point, and
`interactive` because you want to play with it while you go.

```jsx
  <Flight interactive ref={flight => (this.flight = flight)}>
    <Flight.Frame duration={300} source interactive showFrames>
```

### Showing Frames

While designing, you want to have `showFrames` on. It will unpack
all of the frames in front of you, so you could edit them while watching them. With
Webpack hot-reload this becomes a fantastic experience.

When done, remove `showFrames`.

### Controlling Flight Directly

This is where the `ref` addition comes in:

```jsx
  <Flight interactive ref={flight => (this.flight = flight)}>
    <Flight.Frame duration={300} source interactive showFrames>
```

Once you can grab an instance of `flight` you can `flight.play()` and `flight.reset()` on
demand from your own components and actions.

Here's a full layout:

```jsx
  <Flight interactive ref={flight => (this.flight = flight)}>
    <Flight.Frame duration={300} source interactive showFrames>

      -- your own DOM / React Components ---
      -- starting position and styles    ---

    </Flight.Frame>

    <Flight.Frame>

      -- your own DOM / React Components ---
      -- ending position and styles    ---

    </Flight.Frame>
  </Flight>
```





## Next.js

If instead of CRA, you're using Next.js, react-flight will still work, but you need to import the animations on the client side only. Because Next.js tries to render the components on the server side, `window` won't be available to react-flight, causing an error.

So, on your page file (or the parent component right above the component you're using `<Flight>`), instead of:

```javascript
// WRONG USE
import MyAnimatedComponent from '../MyAnimatedComponent'
const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
    	<MyAnimatedComponent />
    </>
  )
}
```

You should use Next.js [dynamic-import](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import):

```javascript
const MyAnimatedComponent = dynamic(() => import('../MyAnimatedComponent'), { ssr: false })
const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <MyAnimatedComponent />
    </>
  )
}
```

Or [NoSSR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-no-ssr)

```javascript
import MyAnimatedComponent from '../MyAnimatedComponent'
const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
  	  <NoSSR onSSR={<Loading />}>
    	  <MyAnimatedComponent />
	    </NoSSR>
    </>
  )
}
```





## Redux

If you're using Redux, there's basic support for it. Basic in the sense that `react-flight` is not
going to handle deep renders of a stateful app with all its gotchas, so YMMV.

You can check out [this Redux example](examples/compos-redux) for a fully working solution.


For your app, you can enable Redux support by indicating inclusion of store before using the `Flight` component:

```javascript
Flight.contextTypes = {
  store: PropTypes.object,
}

Flight.childContextTypes = {
  ...Flight.childContextTypes,
  store: PropTypes.object,
}
```



## Under the Hood

If you want to hack on `react-flight`, here are some context to keep in mind.

`react-flight` does some cool stuff and some DOM-heavy stuff (perhaps less cool?). For the cool stuff, it
walks the component tree, makes decisions about what should move where, and builds
a clean and nice declarative data structure that represents the way compositions should
behave.

Currently it will then hand over this data to a DOM-based adapter, that also uses Velocity.js,
so that it would actually orchestrate the animations. This is where you're welcome
to plug in your own adapter - another animation engine, React Native, and what not.

Happy hacking!
